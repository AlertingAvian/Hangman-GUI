# Hangman-GUI
An unfinished Python program that uses TkInter to make a GUI for the popular game Hangman. (It is easier to do it on a whiteboard)

## Tasks
- [x] Add the menu ribbon
- [x] Add the "Game" sub-menu
- [x] Add the "New Game" and "Exit" options to the "Game" sub-menu
- [x] Add the "Help" sub-menu
- [ ] Add the "About" and "Help" options to the "Help" sub-menu (I have not added the functions for these options)
- [x] Add the GUI widgets
- [x] Add the "add_secret()" function for the "Submit Phrase" button
- [ ] Add the "submit_guess()" function for the "Submit Guess" button (I have not added the function yet)

### Other Notes
> All of this is likely poorly optimized but I am not done yet.
